# King County Housing Price Prediction

## Overview
This project will utilize multiple regression analysis to predict housing prices in King County, Seattle, WA. The training data will be explored for feature building and the final model will be built and trained by SciKit python library. The data and project scope was provide by Flatiron School for Data Science Immersive program phase 2 final project. 

## Business Problem
A Seattle real estate company seeks to increase porfolio in King County Seattle and wants to accurately predict the sales price of a property. Having an accurate sales prediction will aid in strategizing the investment options to maximize their profit. A multiple linaer regression model will be built base on provided property data for this task. 

During the exploratory phase following questions will also be focused on:
1. What location in the county has the highest property value?
2. What aspects of the property brings value?
3. Do renovations have effect on property value?
